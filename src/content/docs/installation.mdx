ZaneOps is a deployment platform that simplifies the process of managing and deploying web applications. This guide will walk you through the steps to install ZaneOps either locally or on a remote server with minimal configuration.


## System requirements

ZaneOps is designed to operate on a variety of environments. For optimal performance, we recommend these Minimum requirements for running zaneops and your services :

- **CPUs:** 4 cores 
- **Memory (RAM):** At least 8 GB
- **Disk:** At least 80 GB of free space

<Aside type="note" title="Information">
On [hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) this costs around 7€/month.
</Aside>

ZaneOps may work properly on servers with lower specs than those mentioned above, but we recommend slightly higher minimum requirements.
Keep in mind that this depends mainly on the resource requirements for your services, if you are running a lot of services that are resource intensive, 
you might need a bigger server, if you want to host static sites though, the minimum requirements might totally be enough.

## Supported OS and architectures

As of now ZaneOps has been tested on these platforms : 

- Debian-based Linux distributions (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu)
- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Raspbian) using ARM architecture
- MacOs Mx series

We can't assure you that zaneops will work on other platforms, but if you try and succeed, we are more than happy to add 
it to our supported OS.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Docker >= `v27.0.3`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and are using a Unix-based machine. It's recommended to use the latest version of Docker to avoid compatibility issues.
- Ensure you have `make`, `curl`, `jq` and `openssl` installed : 
  ```shell
  # on Linux
  sudo apt install make curl jq openssl

  # on Mac
  brew install make curl jq openssl
  ```

## Process

<Steps>
1. **Create the installation directory**:

    Choose a directory for ZaneOps. This guide uses `/var/www/zaneops`:

    ```shell
    mkdir -p /var/www/zaneops 
    cd /var/www/zaneops
    ```

2. Download the makefile for the project :

    ```shell
    curl https://cdn.zaneops.dev/makefile > Makefile
    ```
    
    <Aside type="note">
    The source code for this file is available [on github](https://github.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/blob/main/deploy.mk).
    </Aside>


3. Launch the setup process :

    ```shell
    make setup
    ```

    After this step, your directory structure should look like this:

    <FileTree>

    - zaneops
        - .fluentd/
        - temporalio/
        - docker-stack.prod-http.yaml
        - docker-stack.prod.yaml
        - .env
        - fluent.conf
        - Makefile

    </FileTree>

4. **Update environment variables in `.env`** :
    The setup process will generate sane defaults for environment variables, 
    but you can modify the contents to better suit your needs (see here for [how to customize](#environment-variables-explained)):
    
    ```shell
    # /var/www/zaneops/.env
    # Example configuration - Modify before production use
    IMAGE_VERSION=latest # ZaneOps version to install
    ZANE_APP_DIRECTORY="/var/www/zaneops" # Installation directory for ZaneOps
    ZANE_DB_USER= # Generate with: "curl -s https://randomuser.me/api/ | jq -r '.results[0].login.username'"
    ZANE_DB_PASSWORD= # Generate with: "$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY= # Generate with: "$(openssl rand -base64 64)"

    ROOT_DOMAIN="<YOUR-IP>.sslip.io" # Root domain for generating app domains
    ZANE_APP_DOMAIN="<YOUR-IP>.sslip.io" # Domain for ZaneOps dashboard
    MODE=https # or http
    ```

5. Deploy ZaneOps :

    ```shell
    make deploy
    ```
   Wait for all the containers to start, it should show `replicated 1/1` for all services, 
   except for `temporal-admin-tools` which should show `0/1 (1/1 completed)`. ZaneOps can take up to 5 minutes to start.

6. Create your first user to login to the dashboard :

    ```shell
    make create-user
    ```

7. Log in to the dashboard by connecting to the domain specified in `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN`, if you are on Linux, you should have a log with the domain for zaneops : 
   
   ```shell
   Once everything is ok, zaneops will be accessible at https://198-19-249-134.sslip.io
   ```
   If hosted locally ([see instructions below](#installing-locally)), you can use http://127-0-0-1.sslip.io.

### Environment Variables Explained

1. `IMAGE_VERSION`: Specifies the ZaneOps version to install.
2. `ZANE_APP_DIRECTORY`: Defines the directory where ZaneOps will be installed.
3. `ZANE_DB_USER` / `ZANE_DB_PASSWORD`: Credentials for connecting to the database.
4. `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: Used by the API for various security functions, such as hashing user session tokens. Generate a secure key with at least 64 characters using a tool like [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 64`).
5. `ROOT_DOMAIN`: Used to generate subdomains for deployed web apps, e.g., `my-web-app.127-0-0-1.sslip.io`. The root domain itself can also host the dashboard if desired.
6. `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN`: The domain where the ZaneOps dashboard will be accessible after deployment. It can be the same as `ROOT_DOMAIN`
7. `MODE` : the mode in which to deploy your zaneops instance, should be either `https` or  `http`, if you change this to `http`, it enables the port `80` on your instance, beware as it can be source of security vulnerabilities.
8. `__DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION` : allow for authenticating to zaneops using a domain on `http://`

### Upgrading zaneops 

<Aside type="tip">
While zaneops is being upgraded, all your services will still be available, including the zaneops dashboard. 
</Aside>

zaneops is updated automatically to the version specified in the `.env` file in `IMAGE_VERSION`. 
However if you use the `canary` version, you will automatically be updated to the latest version on the `main` branch, **which can contain breaking changes ⚠️**.

To update the version, change it in `.env` : 

```shell
# /var/www/zaneops/.env
IMAGE_VERSION="v2"
# ... other env variables
```

Then deploy again with : 

```shell
make setup # re-download configuration files to run zaneops 
make deploy
```


### Installing Locally 

ZaneOps can be installed locally with minimal configuration changes. 
To do this :
- keep the `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN` and `ROOT_DOMAIN` environment variables set to http://127-0-0-1.sslip.io :

  ```shell
  # /var/www/zaneops/.env
  # ... other env variables
  ZANE_APP_DOMAIN="127-0-0-1.sslip.io"
  ROOT_DOMAIN="127-0-0-1.sslip.io"
  ```
- add the `__DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION` environment variable, and update the `MODE` variable to open the port `80` :

  ```shell
  # /var/www/zaneops/.env
  # ... other env variables
  MODE=http
  __DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION="true"
  ```
- be sure to top zaneops first :

    ```shell
    make stop
    ``` 

- run the `deploy` command : 
  
  ```shell
  make deploy
  ```
- You can now access zaneops dashboard at http://127-0-0-1.sslip.io

  <Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  You can enable the `__DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION` environment variable in production to access your ZaneOps instance over HTTP.
  However, this is strongly discouraged, as it exposes your application to potential security vulnerabilities, including man-in-the-middle attacks.
