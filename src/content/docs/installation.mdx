import {FileTree, Steps, Aside} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


## Quick-start

You can install ZaneOps with one script:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://cdn.zaneops.dev/install.sh | sudo bash
```


## System requirements

ZaneOps is designed to operate on a variety of environments. For optimal performance, we recommend these requirements for running zaneops and your services :

- **CPUs:** 2 cores 
- **Memory (RAM):** 2 GB
- **Disk:** At least 30 GB of free space


Keep in mind that this depends mainly on the resource requirements for your services, if you are running a lot of services that are resource intensive, 
you might need a bigger server, if you want to host static sites though, these requirements will totally be well enough.

## Supported OS and architectures

As of now ZaneOps has been tested on these platforms : 

- Debian-based Linux distributions (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu)
- Red Hat-based distributions (e.g., CentOS, Fedora)
- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Raspbian) using ARM architecture
- MacOs Mx series
- Alpine Linux
- NixOS
- Arch Linux

We can't assure you that zaneops will work on other platforms, but if you try and succeed, we are more than happy to add 
it to our supported OS.



## Manual installation

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Docker >= `v27.0.3`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and are using a Unix-based machine. It's recommended to use the latest version of Docker to avoid compatibility issues.
- Ensure you have `make`, `curl`, `jq` and `openssl` installed : 
  ```shell
  # on Debian based distributions
  sudo apt install make curl jq openssl

  # on Red Hat-based distributions
  sudo dnf install -y make curl jq openssl

  # on Alpine Linux
  sudo apk add make curl jq openssl

  # on NixOS
  nix-shell -p gnumake curl jq openssl

  # on Arch Linux
  sudo pacman -S --noconfirm make curl jq openssl

  # on Mac
  brew install make curl jq openssl
  ```

<Steps>
1. **Initialize Docker Swarm**:

    ```shell
    docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER_IP>
    ```

    <Aside type="note">
    `MANAGER_IP` is the IP address of your server:
    - You can use your server's public IP.
    - If you have private networking, use the private IP (e.g., **10.0.0.x**).
    - If you are  installing locally ([see instructions below](#installing-locally)), use **127.0.0.1**.
    </Aside>

2. **Create the installation directory**:

    Choose a directory for ZaneOps. This guide uses `/var/www/zaneops`:

    ```shell
    mkdir -p /var/www/zaneops 
    cd /var/www/zaneops
    ```

3. **Download the makefile for the project**:

    ```shell
    curl https://cdn.zaneops.dev/makefile > Makefile
    ```
    The source code for this file is available [on github](https://github.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/blob/main/deploy.mk).



4. **Launch the setup process**:

    ```shell
    make setup
    ```

    After this step, your directory structure should look like this:

    <FileTree>

    - zaneops
        - .fluentd/
        - temporalio/
        - docker-stack.prod-http.yaml
        - docker-stack.prod.yaml
        - .env
        - fluent.conf
        - Makefile

    </FileTree>

5. **Review environment variables in `.env`** :
    The setup process will generate sane defaults for environment variables, the main variables you might want 
    to modify are `ROOT_DOMAIN` and `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN` and they can be set to the same value if desired. See [How to configure DNS records for ZaneOps ?](/configuring-zaneops)
    
    ```shell
    # /var/www/zaneops/.env
    # ...other variables 
    ROOT_DOMAIN="<YOUR-IP>.sslip.io" # Root domain for generating app subdomains
    ZANE_APP_DOMAIN="<YOUR-IP>.sslip.io" # Domain for ZaneOps dashboard
    ```

6. **Start ZaneOps**:

    ```shell
    make deploy
    ```


7. Access the dashboard by connecting to the domain specified in `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN` in the `.env` file. Once the app is up, you will 
   see a **welcome** page asking you to create your first user :
   
   <img className="block dark:hidden" src="https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/create-user-light.png" alt="onboarding page with a form for creating the first user" />
   <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/create-user-dark.png" alt="onboarding page with a form for creating the first user" />
   
   Alternatively, you can create your first user by running this command in the terminal :
   ```shell
   make create-user
   ```
   
   <Aside type="note" title='Installing locally'>
    Please [continue with the instructions below](#installing-locally) if you are installing ZaneOps locally.
   </Aside>

</Steps>


### Installing Locally 

ZaneOps can be installed locally with minimal configuration changes. 
To do this :
- keep the `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN` and `ROOT_DOMAIN` environment variables set to http://127-0-0-1.sslip.io :

  ```shell
  # /var/www/zaneops/.env
  # ... other env variables
  ZANE_APP_DOMAIN="127-0-0-1.sslip.io"
  ROOT_DOMAIN="127-0-0-1.sslip.io"
  ```
- add the `__DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION` environment variable, and update the `MODE` variable to open the port `80` :

  ```shell
  # /var/www/zaneops/.env
  # ... other env variables
  MODE=http
  __DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION="true"
  ```
- be sure to top zaneops first :

    ```shell
    make stop
    ``` 

- run the `deploy` command : 
  
  ```shell
  make deploy
  ```
- You can now access zaneops dashboard at http://127-0-0-1.sslip.io

  <Aside type="caution" title="__DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION">
  You can enable the `__DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION` environment variable in production to access your ZaneOps instance over HTTP.
  However, this is strongly discouraged, as it allows for connecting to your dashboard using non secure cookies.

  [See here](/configuring-zaneops#disabling-ssl) for more info.

### Environment Variables Explained

1. `IMAGE_VERSION`: Specifies the ZaneOps version to install.
2. `ZANE_APP_DIRECTORY`: Defines the directory where ZaneOps will be installed.
3. `ZANE_DB_USER` / `ZANE_DB_PASSWORD`: Credentials for connecting to the database.
4. `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: Used by the API for various security functions, such as hashing user session tokens. Generate a secure key with at least 64 characters using a tool like [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 64`).
5. `ROOT_DOMAIN`: Used to generate subdomains for deployed web apps, e.g., `my-web-app.127-0-0-1.sslip.io`. The root domain itself can also host the dashboard if desired.
6. `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN`: The domain where the ZaneOps dashboard will be accessible after deployment. It can be the same as `ROOT_DOMAIN`
7. `MODE` : the mode in which to deploy your zaneops instance, should be either `https` or  `http`, if you change this to `http`, it enables the port `80` on your instance, beware as it can be source of security vulnerabilities.
8. `__DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION` : allow for authenticating to zaneops using a domain on `http://`
