ZaneOps is a **self-hosted, beautiful and fast** platform for deploying and managing static sites, web apps, databases, services (like Supabase, WordPress, Ghost), workers, or anything else you need. Whether you're launching a startup or managing an enterprise.  

It is a **free** and **open-source** alternative to platforms like **Heroku**, **Railway**, and **Render**, leveraging the **scalability** of [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) and the **flexibility** of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).  

## Why Zaneops ?
