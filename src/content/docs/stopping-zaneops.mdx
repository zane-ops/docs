title: Stopping ZaneOps
description: Stopping ZaneOps
---

This process will stop zaneops and scale down all services managed by zaneops to `0`, effectively removing all the running containers.
You can always restart everything using `make deploy`.

```shell
# Shut down ZaneOps and all managed services
make stop
```
