### ☁️ ZaneOps Cloud waitlist 

We have officially opened the waitlist for [ZaneOps Cloud](/cloud). ZaneOps Cloud is meant to be the next evolution of 
ZaneOps for enterprise and PRO users. It will come packed with features:

- **Multi tenancy**: with support for multiple teams and with exhaustive permissions configuration 
- **OIDC Authentication**: Enterprise-grade authentication with OpenID Connect support, with SSO support and more
- **Audit logs**: to track all activity: logins, deployments, service changes, and more
- **Custom authentication pages for services**: to protect your services with login pages 
- **Custom branding**: to customize your authentication pages 
- ...and more

Join the [waitlist](/cloud) now to be updated on when the cloud version is available, and if you sponsor the project you 
can be a member of the **early access** of the cloud version. 

<Aside type="tip" title='Open Source'>
The open source version will stay free and under the MIT licence.

### Docker compose stacks

The major feature for this new version is support for [docker compose stacks](/knowledge-base/docker-compose), they allow you 
to deploy your app from a `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Templates

You can create applications from docker-compose files, but also deploy from [templates](/knowledge-base/docker-compose/01-templates). 
ZaneOps support two template providers:

- Our custom templates:

- Dokploy templates (experimental);

### Shared volumes

You can create volumes that are shared between multiple services, with one service as the owner and many readers:

### Docker registry credentials

To deploy private images, previously you had to manually enter the credentials, now you can 
create shared credentials accross your apps.

### Build registries

To prepare for multi servers, you can now setup a build registry to build and publish your built 
apps to a registry. you can choose to either store the images in the filesystem of your 
ZaneOps server or use a S3 provider (AWS S3, minio, R2, etc.)

    > TODO: image src
- After creating a SSH key in the server settings, you get the commands to add the key to your server
    > TODO: image src
- ZaneOps will remember the last SSH key you used to connect to the server terminal and automatically reconnect you when you 
  navigate to the console

- Environment variables are now obfuscated in the build logs, as well as in the change fields where they are hidden by default
