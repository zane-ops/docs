### ZaneOps Cloud ☁️ waitlist

The waitlist for [ZaneOps Cloud](/cloud) is now open. ZaneOps Cloud is the next evolution of the platform, designed for teams and enterprise users. It will ship with:

- **Multi-tenancy**: support for multiple teams with fine-grained permissions
- **OIDC Authentication**: enterprise-grade SSO via OpenID Connect
- **Audit logs**: full activity trail of logins, deployments, service changes, and more
- **Custom authentication pages**: protect any service behind a login page
- **Custom branding**: white-label your authentication pages
- ...and more

[Join the waitlist](/cloud) to be notified when the cloud version launches. [Sponsor the project](https://github.com/sponsors/zane-ops) to get **early access** when it does.

<Aside type="tip" title='Open Source'>
The self-hosted version will remain free and MIT-licensed.

### Docker Compose stacks

The headline feature of v1.13 is native [Docker Compose stack support](/knowledge-base/docker-compose). You can now deploy any `docker-compose.yml` file directly on ZaneOps.

Under the hood, compose files are deployed as [Docker stacks](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/stack/), with:

- blue/green deployments out of the box
- domain assignment via service labels
- dynamic value generation via template expressions (e.g. `{{ generate_password | 8 }}` generates a secure 8-character password)

### Templates

Beyond raw compose files, you can also deploy from pre-built [templates](/knowledge-base/docker-compose/01-templates). ZaneOps supports two template providers:

- Our own curated templates:

- Dokploy templates (experimental):

### Shared volumes

You can now create volumes shared across multiple services. One service owns the volume, and others mount it as read-only. This is useful for sharing assets, media, or uploads between a backend and frontend, for example.

Shared volumes are fully compatible with blue/green deployments.

### Docker registry credentials

Deploying private images no longer requires entering credentials on every service. You can now create registry credentials once and reuse them across all your apps.

### Build registries

In preparation for multi-server support, you can now configure a build registry to store Docker images built by ZaneOps. Choose between storing images on your server's filesystem or pushing them to an S3-compatible provider (AWS S3, MinIO, R2, etc.).

- Git services now receive `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` as both a build arg and an environment variable

- After creating an SSH key in server settings, ZaneOps now shows the exact commands to add it to your server

- ZaneOps remembers the last SSH key used in the server terminal and automatically reconnects you on your next visit
