### ☁️ ZaneOps Cloud waitlist 

We have officially opened the waitlist for [ZaneOps Cloud](/cloud). ZaneOps Cloud is meant to be the next evolution of 
ZaneOps for enterprise and PRO users. It will come packed with features:

- **Multi tenancy**: with support for multiple teams and with exhaustive permissions configuration 
- **OIDC Authentication**: Enterprise-grade authentication with OpenID Connect support, with SSO support and more
- **Audit logs**: to track all activity: logins, deployments, service changes, and more
- **Custom authentication pages for services**: to protect your services with login pages 
- **Custom branding**: to customize your authentication pages 
- ...and more

Join the [waitlist](/cloud) now to be updated on when the cloud version is available, and if you sponsor the project you 
can be a member of the **early access** of the cloud version. 

<Aside type="tip" title='Open Source'>
The open source version will stay free and under the MIT licence.

### Docker compose stacks

The major feature for this new version is support for [docker compose stacks](/knowledge-base/docker-compose), they allow you 
to deploy your app from a `docker-compose.yml` file.

Docker compose iles on ZaneOps are deployed as [docker stack](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/stack/)
with support for : 
- blue/green deployments by default 
- assigning domains to your services via labels
- Generating variable & secrets values via template expressions (ex: `{{ generate_password | 8 }}` to generate secure 8 chars password)

### Templates

You can create applications from docker-compose files, but also deploy from [templates](/knowledge-base/docker-compose/01-templates). 
ZaneOps support two template providers:

- Our custom templates:

- Dokploy templates (experimental);

### Shared volumes

You can create volumes that are shared between multiple services, with one service as the owner and many readers:

You use them to access data between services, by referencing the same volume. This is useful if you want to share assets, medias or uploads between a backend & frontend (for ex).
 
 When you reference a shared volumes, the volume will be attached as read-only and still allow for blue/green deployments.

### Docker registry credentials

To deploy private images, previously you had to manually enter the credentials, now you can 
create shared credentials accross your apps.

### Build registries

To prepare for multi servers, you can now setup a build registry to store the docker images of the applications that are built on ZaneOps. you can choose to either store the images in the filesystem of your 
ZaneOps server or use a S3 provider (AWS S3, minio, R2, etc.)

### Other changes

- Git services now receive `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` as a build arg and environment variables when building the app
    > TODO: image src
- After creating a SSH key in the server settings, you get the commands to add the key to your server
    > TODO: image src
- ZaneOps will remember the last SSH key you used to connect to the server terminal and automatically reconnect you when you 
  navigate to the console
    > TODO: image src
- Environment variables are now obfuscated in the build logs, as well as in the change fields where they are hidden by default
    > TODO: image src
