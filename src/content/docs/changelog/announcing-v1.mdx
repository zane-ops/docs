ZaneOps v1.0 is finally here!

ZaneOps is a beautiful, self-hosted, open-source platform for hosting static sites, web apps, databases, services (like Supabase, WordPress, Ghost), workers, or anything else you need‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre launching a startup or managing an enterprise.

Today, ZaneOps is stable and production-ready.

## Install ZaneOps

Installation steps are detailled on the [installation page](/installation), but here is the TLDR:

```shell
# create directory to install zaneops
mkdir -p /var/www/zaneops && cd /var/www/zaneops

# download zaneops CLI
curl https://cdn.zaneops.dev/makefile > Makefile

# setup zaneops 
make setup 

# start zaneops app 
make deploy 
```

## Why ZaneOps exists ?

The goal of ZaneOps is to bring together the best features we could ~~steal~~ take inspiration from popular platforms like 
**Vercel**, **Railway**, and **Render**, while giving you full ownership of your data and complete control over your server costs.
