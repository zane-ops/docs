Today we release zaneOps v1.8 introducing our all new [Git services](/knowledge-base/git-services). 

**To install :**

```shell
# assuming you are at /var/www/zaneops
curl https://cdn.zaneops.dev/makefile > Makefile
make setup
make deploy
```

### Git services

We made our first step towards supporting creating services from git repositories, you can now point a public repository 
which contains a `Dockerfile` to ZaneOps and it will build it for you :

### Bulk actions 

You can now select multiple services in one environment and apply bulk actions to them.

### other changes

Logs are now separated from deployments and runtime logs. with runtime logs being all the logs your services produce and deployment logs 
for build and logs produced by ZaneOps.
