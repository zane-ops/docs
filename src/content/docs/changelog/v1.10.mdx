Today we release ZaneOps v1.10, introducing a web terminal for deployments and a web terminal to the server.

**To install:**

1. via the UI:
 <img className="block dark:hidden" src="https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/new-version-toast-light.png" alt="clone environment modal" />
 <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/new-version-toast-dark.png" alt="clone environment modal" />
 <img className="block dark:hidden" src="https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/new-version-modal-light.png" alt="project environments page" />
 <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/new-version-modal-dark.png" alt="project environments page" />

2. via the shell:
```shell
# assuming you are at /var/www/zaneops
curl https://cdn.zaneops.dev/makefile > Makefile
make setup
make deploy
```

### Shells to deployments

In this new version, we are introducing a new terminal directly to your service, allowing you to inspect containers created for your service by ZaneOps and debug or run any arbitrary script within it.

### Shell to the server

As well as terminals to your deployments, you can now connect to your server via SSH directly from the web UI.

In the demo below, you can see the user connecting via SSH to their server and triggering an update of ZaneOps via the shell directly.
*Pretty cool, huh?*

This feature works using SSH keys, [learn more about how to configure](/knowledge-base/ssh-keys).

### Persistent cache

In v1.10, we introduce a new performance improvement on the frontend. 
Between each new version, you will have persistent cache on the browser, so that next time you access your app, navigation is very snappy even if you refresh the browser.

Here is a demo where you can see:
- On top: without persistent storage
- On the bottom: with persistent storage

### Anonymous Telemetry

We introduced a new anonymous telemetry feature to help us better understand the real usage of ZaneOps in production.

It works by sending a simple `PING` request at most every 30 minutes to the ZaneOps CDN ([cdn.zaneops.dev](https://cdn.zaneops.dev)).

The source code of the CDN can be found [here](https://github.com/zane-ops/cdn/tree/main/src/index.ts).

Anonymous telemetry can be disabled by modifying the env variable in `.env`:

```shell
# /var/www/zaneops/.env
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false # or true
```

### Docker Image Size reduction

The ZaneOps Docker image is lighter and has a smaller number of layers, going from **1.5GB** to **902MB**.

So downloading new versions of ZaneOps should be faster in future releases ⚡️.

### Thank you! 🫶
