Today we release zaneOps v1.10 introducing web terminal for deployments, and a web terminal to the server.


**To install :**

1. via the UI : 
    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/new-version-toast-light.png" alt="clone environment modal" />
    <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/new-version-toast-dark.png" alt="clone environment modal" />

    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/new-version-modal-light.png" alt="project environments page" />
    <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/new-version-modal-dark.png" alt="project environments page" />


3. via the shell :
    ```shell
    # assuming you are at /var/www/zaneops
    curl https://cdn.zaneops.dev/makefile > Makefile
    make setup
    make deploy
    ```

### Shells to deployments

In this new version, we are introducing a new terminal directly to your service, allowing you to inspect 
containers created for your service by ZaneOps and debug or run any arbitrary script within it.

### Shell to the server

As well as terminals to your deployments, you can now connect to your server via SSH directly from the web UI. 
In the demo, you can see the user connecting via SSH to their server and triggering an update of ZaneOps via the shell 
from within directly. _pretty cool uh ?_

This feature works using SSH keys, [learn more how to configure](#).

### Persistent cache 

In v1.10, we introduce a new performance improvement on the frontend, between each new version, you will have a persistent cache on the browser.
So that next time you access your app, navigation is very snappy even if you refresh the browser. 

Here is a demo where, you can see: 
- On top : without persistent storage 
- On the bottom : with persistent storage

### Anonymous Telemetry 

We introduced a new anonymous telemetry to allows us to better see the real usage of ZaneOps in production.

It works by sending a simple `PING` request at most every 30 minutes to the ZaneOps CDN ([cdn.zaneops.dev](https://cdn.zaneops.dev)). 
The code source of the CDN can be found [here](https://github.com/zane-ops/cdn/tree/main/src/index.ts).

Anonymous telemetry can be disabled by modifying the env variable in  `.env`: 

```shell
# /var/www/zaneops/.env
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false # or true
```

### Docker Image Size reduction 

ZaneOps docker image is lighter and with a smaller number of layers, going from **1.5GB** to **902MB**.

So downloading new versions of ZaneOps should be faster in the next releases ‚ö°Ô∏è.

### Thank you! ü´∂

- We have now on more than **500 stars** ‚≠êÔ∏è on the repository 
- And **100+ more installs** üîù on ZaneOps 

Thank you all for making this happens üôè
