description: 'See all the new and interesting changes in ZaneOps v1.7'
---

Since the release of [v1.0](./announcing-v1.mdx), we added a lot more changes. 

**To install :**

```shell
# assuming you are at /var/www/zaneops
curl https://cdn.zaneops.dev/makefile > Makefile
make setup
make deploy
```

### Environments

Environments let you separate your services logically accross isolated instances. Within environments you 
can share environment variables available accross all the services within the environment. You can [learn more here](/knowledge-base/environments).

<img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/project-environments-dark.png" alt="project environments page" />

You can clone environments and copy all the services, variables and configurations to the new environment : 

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/project-clone-environment-light.png" alt="clone environment modal" />
<img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/project-clone-environment-dark.png" alt="clone environment modal" />

Accross environments you can also have multiple services with the same name :

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/project-environment-search-light.png" alt="searching a service accross multiple environments" />
<img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/project-environment-search-dark.png" alt="searching a service accross multiple environments" />



### New Onboarding Page

Now, when you install ZaneOps on a blank instance, you will be greated by an onboarding page allowing you to create
a first user directly from the UI rather than only from the terminal :

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/create-user-light.png" alt="onboarding page with a form for creating the first user" />
<img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/create-user-dark.png" alt="onboarding page with a form for creating the first user" />



### New Upgrading experience

Starting with [v1.7.0](https://github.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/releases/tag/v1.7.0), 
future upgrades will trigger a toast notification informing you of new ZaneOps versions,
 enabling you to upgrade directly from the UI instead of relying solely on the terminal.

## Other changes

- Changed the logs configuration to only logs the result of monitoring health checks if they fail, significantly reducing clutter 
  on the logs page
- Added confirmation modals for destructive actions, for when you want to delete a project, environment or service :
  ![delete environment confirmation modal](/images/delete-environment-confirmation.png)
  ![delete project confirmation modal](/images/delete-project-confirmation.png)
  ![delete service confirmation modal](/images/delete-service-confirmation.png)
  ![toggle sleep service confirmation modal](/images/toggle-sleep-service-confirmation.png)

## Bug fixes

- We fixed some occasional `502 Bad Gateway` error you would encounter when you deploy services in [#406](https://github.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/pull/406)
- We fixed some bugs with the metrics not being collected correctly and resulting in you not seeing the metrics of certain services in [#383](https://github.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/pull/383)
