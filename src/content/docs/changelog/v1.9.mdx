### Nixpacks builder

[nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com) is an open source tool developped by [railway](https://railway.app) that automatically detects your stack, language or framework
and produce a Dockerfile for building your application. 
With this, when you want to deploy a new service, no need to specify a `Dockerfile`

### Static directory builder
