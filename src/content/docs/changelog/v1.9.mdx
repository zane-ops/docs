### Nixpacks builder

[Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com) is an open source tool developped by [railway](https://railway.app) that automatically detects your stack, language or framework
and produce a Dockerfile for building your application. 

With this, when you want to deploy a new service, no need to specify a `Dockerfile` when deploying a service from a git repository, 
whether it is a next.js web application, a Svelte SPA or a Django backend API, it will automatically detect it for you.

#### Bonus: static websites

In some cases, you might want to deploy a statically generated websites. 
You can check static website checkbox when creating your service or in your service settings.

### Railpack builder

[Railpack](https://railpack.com) is the new version of Nixpacks by Railway, still open source. The benefits over Nixpacks are 
faster builds and smaller image sizes. The railpack builder support all the same options as the Nixpacks builder. 

As of now the railpack builder is in **bÃªta** as a v1 of railpack hasn't been released yet.

### Static directory builder

In ZaneOps, you can deploy a simple HTML/CSS/JS pre-built static website, 
it will be deployed as a simple [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) with alpine docker container.
