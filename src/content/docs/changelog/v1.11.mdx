### Git apps

[Git apps](/knowledge-base/git-apps) are integrations with providers like GitHub and GitLab that allows you to 
listen to git events to your repositories as well as perform actions on your behalf.
They are installed either on your profile or in an organization you are a member of.

Using Git apps on ZaneOps, you get:

- Support for private GitHub and GitLab repositories.

- Auto-deploy on git push:

### Cleanup deploy queue

You can now cleanup the queue when making a new deployment, this way if there are multiple deployments queued, only the latest is considered, the other ones are cancelled

- You can choose to cleanup the deploy queue when triggering a new deployment:
    <video src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/videos/cleanup-queue-preserve-latest.mp4`} controls muted></video>
- Or simply cleanup all the deployments in the queue:
    <video src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/videos/cleanup-deploy-queue.mp4`} controls muted></video>
