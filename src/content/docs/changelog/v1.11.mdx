Today we release zaneOps v1.11 introducing support for private **GitHub** and **Gitlab** repositories as well as auto-deploy on git push
all via [Git apps](/knowledge-base/git/git-apps).

### Git apps


[Git apps](/knowledge-base/git/git-apps) are integrations with [**GitHub**](/knowledge-base/git/github) and [**GitLab**](/knowledge-base/git/github) that allow you to
listen to Git events from your repositories and perform actions on your behalf.
They can be installed either on your personal profile or within an organization youâ€™re a member of.

With Git apps on ZaneOps, you get:

- Support for private GitHub and GitLab repositories.

- [Auto-deploy on Git push](/knowledge-base/git/auto-deploy):

<Aside type="note" title='supported providers'>
Currently, only **GitHub** and **GitLab** apps are supported.

### Cleanup deploy queue

You can now clean up the deployment queue when triggering a new deployment.
For example, if multiple deployments are queued, only the latest one will be kept, the others will be canceled.

- Choose to clean up the queue while preserving the latest deployment:

- Or clean up all deployments in the queue:
    <video src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/videos/cleanup-deploy-queue.mp4`} controls muted></video>
