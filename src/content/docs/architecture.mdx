ZaneOps is a self-hosted PaaS platform designed to manage, deploy, and monitor services with [docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/). 
Each service and app deployed on ZaneOps correspond one-to-one to a [swarm service]((https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/)).


## Components

<img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/main-architecture.svg`} alt="Main architecture" />


**üîå Proxy (`caddy`)**
Acts as the single entrypoint for all HTTP traffic. Routes API and service requests appropriately and serves static assets.

**üß† App (Backend + Frontend)**
- **Backend**: Django + Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: Single Page App (SPA) made with React Router
- Provides the user interface and the core API logic.

**‚öôÔ∏è Workers**
- Run scheduled/background jobs.
- Use the same Docker image as the main app.

**üßæ Log Collector (`fluentd`)**
- Aggregates all logs from running services.
- Collects logs from proxy for [HTTP logs](/screenshots/#http-logs-page).

**üîç Log Searcher (`grafana/loki`)**
- Stores and indexes logs for querying.

**‚ö°Ô∏è Cache (`valkey`)**
- Used for caching and session storage.

**üóÉÔ∏è Database (`PostgreSQL`)**
- Stores all persistent application data.

**üì¨ Task Queue (`temporal`)**
- Orchestrates background tasks and worker coordination.

## Core Scenarios

### 1. Deploy a New Service

#### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
1. **User Action**:  
   `PUT /deploys/XYZ` is sent to the proxy.

2. **Routing**:  
   The proxy forwards it to the app backend.

3. **App Logic**:  
   App creates a new deployment record in the database with status `PENDING`.

4. **Task Queue**:  
   App sends a `deploy_service(XYZ)` message to the task queue (Temporal).

5. **Worker Execution**:  
   A worker picks up the task and runs the deployment logic (Docker service creation).

6. **Completion**:  
   Worker notifies the task queue that the task is done.

7. **State Update**:  
   Worker updates the Deployment state in the DB  to `HEALTHY` or `FAILED`.

8. **Proxy Mapping**:  
   The proxy maps `xyz.com` to the new service, e.g., `service_XYZ:3000`.
</Steps>

### 2. Deploy the same service again

#### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
1. **User Action**:  
   `PUT /deploys/XYZ` sent again.

2. **App Processing**:  
   The app creates a new deployment version and sends a deploy task.

3. **Worker Logic**:
   * Stops (removes) the previous Docker service (v1).
   * Starts a new one with the updated spec (v2).

4. **State Update**:  
   DB updated accordingly (`HEALTHY` or `FAILED`).

5. **Proxy Keeps Same Mapping**:  
   `xyz.com` still points to `service_XYZ`, which now resolves to the new container.

</Steps>

### 3. Access a Running Service

#### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
1. **User Request**:  
   Browser makes `GET xyz.com`.

2. **Proxy Resolution**:  
   Proxy resolves the domain to the correct internal service (Docker alias or internal hostname).

3. **Routing**:  
   The request is forwarded to the running container.

4. **Response**:  
   Container sends back the HTTP response via the proxy.
</Steps>

### 4. Logs Collection

<img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/logs-collection-scenario.svg`} alt="Log collection scenario" />

#### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
1. **Logs Emitted**:  
   Each service sends logs to Fluentd over `stdout`.

2. **Collector Buffering**:  
   Fluentd waits ~5 seconds and tags/filters logs.

3. **Forward to App**:  
   Logs are forwarded to the API `/logs/ingest`.

4. **App Preprocessing**:  
   Enriches logs (adds metadata like service/deployment IDs).

5. **Send to Loki**:  
   App sends structured logs to Loki.
</Steps>


### 5. Logs Search

#### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
1. **User Request**:  
   `GET /search/logs` hits the proxy.

2. **Routing**:  
   Proxy forwards to the app backend.

3. **Query Execution**:  
   App translates filters and queries Loki.

4. **Return**:  
   Logs are returned to the frontend (paginated, filtered, etc.).
