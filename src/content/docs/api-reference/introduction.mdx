## Common Errors status codes

### 405 Method Not Allowed

This is returned when an endpoint is called with an unexpected http method. For example, if updating a user requires
a POST request and a PATCH is issued instead, this error is returned. Here's how it looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "client_error",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "method_not_allowed",
      "detail": "Method “patch” not allowed.",
      "attr": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### 406 Not Acceptable

This is returned if the `Accept` header is submitted and contains a value other than `application/json`. Here's how the
response would look:

```json
{
  "type": "client_error",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "not_acceptable",
      "detail": "Could not satisfy the request Accept header.",
      "attr": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### 415 Unsupported Media Type

This is returned when the request content type is not json. Here's how the response would look:

```json
{
  "type": "client_error",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "not_acceptable",
      "detail": "Unsupported media type “application/xml” in request.",
      "attr": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### 500 Internal Server Error

This is returned when the API server encounters an unexpected error. Here's how the response would look:

```json
{
  "type": "server_error",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "error",
      "detail": "A server error occurred.",
      "attr": null
    }
  ]
}
```
