To access your server through the ZaneOps web UI, you will need to use SSH keys.
Each key is associated with a user on your server.

### How to use SSH Keys

<Steps>
1. You can access the SSH keys in the settings.

2. Once there, you can create a new key with a **valid user on your server** and a name for the key.
    ![Create new SSH key](https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/create-ssh-key.png)

3. After clicking _"Add new Key"_, ZaneOps will generate a public/private key pair.
    You can then use the public key on your server.

4. Next, you will need to add the key to your server in your user directory: 
    ```shell
    # create `~/.ssh` folder if it doesn't exist
    mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh 
    # create `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file if it doesn't exist
    touch $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
    # Allow permissions to use `authorized_keys` for authentication with SSH
    chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

5. Copy the public SSH key and add it at the end of the file on a new line in `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`

    <Aside type='caution' title='Warning'>
        You need to add the public SSH key in the folder of the user that you specified when creating the key.

6. You can now use the key to SSH to your server from ZaneOps:

</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

1. **Cannot connect to PORT 22**: 

    ```shell
    Failed to connect to port 22: Connection refused
    ``` 

    You will need to modify the SSH port to **22** to have access through the web UI:
    ```shell
    # /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    #... other options
    Port 22
    #... other options
    ```

2. **Public key authentication is disabled**:

    ```shell
    Failed publickey for <username> from 192.168.1.100 port 22 ssh2: RSA SHA256:...
    ``` 
    You will need to enable it in the SSH configuration: 
    ```shell
    # /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
