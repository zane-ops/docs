> Introduced in [**v1.7.0**](/changelog/v17)

ZaneOps supports complex development workflows through environments, giving you isolated instances of all services in a project.
When you create a project, by default it comes with a **production** environment, you cann't rename or delete that environment.

## Create an Environment

<Steps>

1. In the project environments page `+ New Environment` 
    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/project-environments-light.png" alt="project environments page" />
    <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/project-environments-dark.png" alt="project environments page" />


2. Choose which type of environment to create :
    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/project-clone-environment-light.png" alt="clone environment modal" />
    <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/project-clone-environment-dark.png" alt="clone environment modal" />

    1. If you select one environment in the `Clone Environment` dropdown, it will creates a copy of the selected environment, including services, variables, and configurations.
        - If you check  `deploy services ?` all the services will be deployed upon cloning
        - If you don't check  `deploy services ?`, all services and their configuration will be staged for deployment, You will need to review and deploy manually all the staged changes.

    2. If you don't select any environment in the dropdown, it will create an empty environment with no services in it. 
</Steps>



<Aside type="tip" title='Use case for cloning'>
One neat use-case of cloning environments is that it allows you to create a **staging** environment based on the default **production** environment

## Shared Environment variables

Shared variables are inherited by all the services in this environment. 
If a service has the same variable, that will take precedence over the variable defined in this environment.
You can reference these variables in services with `{{env.VARIABLE_NAME}}`.

ZaneOps will automatically replace the variable in the service :
