ZaneOps runs regularly automated jobs such as :

- A log collection job every 5s
- One metrics collection job for each service every 5s
- An automated docker system cleanup every 4h
- A log and metrics cleanup job every day at midnight

## Log & metrics retention policy

To optimize the storage on your server, the logs and metrics cleanup job deletes logs that are older than **2 weeks** (14 days) and deletes metrics that are older than **30 days**.

Only application logs are deleted, HTTP logs are not deleted.

## Automated docker system cleanup 

The automated system cleanup runs every 4h and executes these steps in order : 

1. Cleanup all unused images
2. Cleanup all unused containers
3. Cleanup all unused volumes except the ones managed by zaneops
4. Cleanup all unused networks

You can find the source code of the system cleanup job [here](https://github.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/blob/ee40dc332427b332d7179d3f22f5bd43e5021299/backend/zane_api/temporal/workflows.py#L666-L705).

This job is only executed when there is no current deployment running.
