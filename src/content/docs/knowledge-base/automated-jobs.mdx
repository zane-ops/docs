ZaneOps regularly runs the following automated jobs:

- Log collection every **5 seconds**
- Metrics collection for each service every **5 seconds**
- Automated Docker system cleanup every **4 hours**
- Log and metrics cleanup every **day at midnight**

## Log & metrics retention policy

To optimize storage on your server, the log and metrics cleanup job:

- Deletes logs older than **14 days** (2 weeks)
- Deletes metrics older than **30 days**

Only **application logs** are deleted; **HTTP logs** are retained.


## Automated Docker System Cleanup

The automated system cleanup runs every **4 hours** and performs the following steps in order:

1. Remove all unused images
2. Remove all unused containers
3. Remove all unused volumes (except those managed by ZaneOps)
4. Remove all unused networks

You can find the source code for the system cleanup job [here](https://github.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/blob/ee40dc332427b332d7179d3f22f5bd43e5021299/backend/zane_api/temporal/workflows.py#L666-L705).

This job runs **only** when no deployments are in progress.
