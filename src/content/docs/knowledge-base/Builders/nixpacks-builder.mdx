> Introduced in [**v1.9.0**](/changelog/v19)

<Aside type="caution" title='Docker build resource usage'>
The Docker build process can consume up to 100% of your server's resources, potentially slowing it to a crawl.
Make sure your server is powerful enough to handle it.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title='Network access'>
    When building your application, the build process will happen inside of the same network as your service,
    allowing you to access services inside of the same network.
</Aside>

[Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com) is an open source tool developped by [railway](https://railway.app) that automatically detects your stack, language or framework
and produce a Dockerfile for building your application. 

With this, when you want to deploy a new service, no need to specify a `Dockerfile` when deploying a service from a git repository, 
whether it is a next.js web application, a Svelte SPA or a Django backend API, it will automatically detect it for you. 


## How to create a service with with nixpacks

You can specify the nixpacks builder when creating your service or modify the builder at any moment in the service's settings.

- You need to specify a **build directory**, where nixpacks will detect and build your application, relative to the root of your repository
- You can specify custom **install**, **build** and **start** commands to configure nixpacks and override the auto-generated 
  commands by nixpacks

## Static websites

The nixpacks builder support deploying static websites, when deploying a static website with ZaneOps, it will be built as a service using a  [caddy on alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) image,
with your build assets copied exposed as a file server.
For that you need to check the static website checkbox and specify a publish directory relative to the build directory.

- You can also specify the path for a custom not found page, relative to the **published directory**, used for handling all 404 errors.
- If your app is a **Single Page Application (SPA)**, you can check the box and specify the location of **index.html** page to redirect requests to, 
  the Not found page is ignored as all requests will be sent to the **index.html** page instead.

### Overriding the default Caddyfile

When updating your options in the UI, ZaneOps will show you a preview of the generated [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile) that will be used to expose the static 
assets generated by your app.
![Nixpacks static settings](/images/nixpacks-builder-static.png)

You can override the generated file by providing a Caddyfile at the root of your **build directory**. 
When specifying this, ZaneOps use it over the default generated one in the UI.

With this you can add things like caching to your static websites, or simple HTTP basic authentication. 

When specifying a custom Caddyfile, you can use :
- the environment variable **`$PUBLIC_ROOT`** as the root for static files
- the environment variable **`$PORT`** as the port for exposing your app

Here is A fully working example of a custom Caddyfile : 
```ini
# ./Caddyfile
# expose your app to $PORT and use 80 if undefined
:{$PORT:80} {
    # Set the root directory for static files
    root * {$PUBLIC_ROOT}
    # Serve static files 
    file_server
    # Add `cache-control` header to static assets, images and videos
    @assets {
        path_regexp assets \.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf|mp4)$
    }
    header @assets Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    # For all 404 errors, show a custom page
    handle_errors {
        @404 {
            expression {http.error.status_code} == 404
        }
        rewrite @404 ./404/index.html
        file_server
    }
}
```


## Configuring nixpacks

To configure nixpacks, you can :

1. Alongside the custom **install/build/start** commands, you can customize nixpacks by passing all environment 
   variables supported by nixpacks, they all starts with `NIXPACKS_`.
   

   You can find the common Nixpacks environment variables here : https://nixpacks.com/docs/configuration/environment 
   
   For specific environment variables related to the provider detected by Nixpacks, you will need to refer to the docs for that provider. 
   For ex, you can override the node version with `NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION` for the `Node` provider : https://nixpacks.com/docs/providers/node 

   Here is an example of environment variables you can add : 
   ```shell
   NIXPACKS_APT_PACKAGES="wget,git" # install wget & git with apt-get 
   NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION="22.x" # install node `22`
   ```
2. You can add a custom [nixpacks.toml](https://nixpacks.com/docs/configuration/file) configuration file, at the root of your **build directory** : 
   
   With this you can add more steps to the build process, customize the different commands, and even change the auto-detected provider by nixpacks.

   Here's an example of a nixpacks configuration that : 
   - adds a new step
   - customize the build command 
   - and install custom apt packages
   ```toml
   # ./nixpacks.toml
   [phases.setup]
    aptPkgs = ["...", "wget", "git"]   # Install git & wget packages with apt-get

   [phases.lint] # add new `lint` step
    cmds = ["yarn run lint"]
    dependsOn = ["install"]

   [phases.build] 
    dependsOn = ["...", "lint"] # build should come after `lint`
    cmds = ["pnpm run db:generate && pnpm run build"]
   ```

## Default Environment variables

when building with nixpacks, we will pass a default environment variable `FORCE_COLOR=true` for coloring build outputs.
