Builders are tools used to package [Git services](/knowledge-base/git) into deployable containers.
They either detect or generate a **Dockerfile**, then build your application using `docker build`.

Supported builders include:
- [Nixpacks](./nixpacks-builder)
- [Railpack](./railpack-builder)
- [Dockerfile](./dockerfile-builder)
- [Static directory](./static-dir-builder)

<Aside type="caution" title='Docker build resource usage'>
The Docker build process can consume up to 100% of your server's resources, potentially slowing it to a crawl.
Make sure your server is powerful enough to handle it.

ZaneOps will try to limit the resource usage of the build process to **~33%** to avoid that, but 
it is not guaranteed to work for every builder.

#### Accessing other services

When building your application, all the services from the same project are available, you can reference them using their network alias.
