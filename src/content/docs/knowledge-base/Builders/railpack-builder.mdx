> Introduced in [**v1.9.0**](/changelog/v19)

<Aside type="caution" title='Docker build resource usage'>
The Docker build process can consume up to 100% of your server's resources, potentially slowing it to a crawl.
Make sure your server is powerful enough to handle it.
</Aside>
<Aside type="tip" title='Network access'>
    When building your application, the build process will happen inside of the same network as your service,
    allowing you to access services inside of the same network.

[Railpack](https://railpack.com) is the new version of [Nixpacks](/knowledge-base/builders/nixpacks-builder/) by Railway, still open source. The benefits over Nixpacks are 
faster builds and smaller image sizes. The Railpack builder support all the same options as the Nixpacks builder. 

The Railpack builder is in **bÃªta** for now, as a **v1** of railpack hasn't been released yet. 

## How to create a service with with railpack

You can specify the Railpack builder when creating your service or modify the builder at any moment in the service's settings. 

![Create a service with Railpack builder](/images/create-git-service-railpack-builder.png)

- You need to specify a **build directory**, where Railpack will detect and build your application, relative to the root of your repository
- You can specify custom **install**, **build** and **start** commands to configure Railpack and override the auto-generated 
  commands by Railpack

## Static websites

The Railpack builder support deploying static websites, when deploying a static website with ZaneOps, it will be built as a service using a [caddy on alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) image,
with your build assets copied exposed as a file server.
For that you need to check the static website checkbox and specify a publish directory relative to the build directory.

- You can also specify the path for a custom not found page, relative to the **published directory**, used for handling all 404 errors.
- If your app is a **Single Page Application (SPA)**, you can check the box and specify the location of **index.html** page to redirect requests to, 
  the Not found page is ignored as all requests will be sent to the **index.html** page instead.

### Overriding the default Caddyfile

When updating your options in the UI, ZaneOps will show you a preview of the generated [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile) that will be used to expose the static 
assets generated by your app.

You can override the generated file by providing a Caddyfile at the root of your **build directory**. 
When specifying this, ZaneOps use it over the default generated one in the UI.

With this you can add things like caching to your static websites, or simple HTTP basic authentication. 
When specifying a custom Caddyfile, you can use :
- the environment variable **`$PUBLIC_ROOT`** as the root for static files
- the environment variable **`$PORT`** as the port for exposing your app

Here is A fully working example of a custom Caddyfile : 
```ini
# ./Caddyfile
# expose your app to $PORT and use 80 if undefined
:{$PORT:80} {
    # Set the root directory for static files
    root * {$PUBLIC_ROOT}
    # Serve static files 
    file_server
    # Add `cache-control` header to static assets, images and videos
    @assets {
        path_regexp assets \.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf|mp4)$
    }
    header @assets Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    # For all 404 errors, show a custom page
    handle_errors {
        @404 {
            expression {http.error.status_code} == 404
        }
        rewrite @404 ./404/index.html
        file_server
    }
}
```



## Configuring railpack

Alongside the custom **install/build/start** commands, you can configure railpack by passing all environment 
variables supported by railpack, they all starts with `RAILPACK_`.


You can find the common Railpack environment variables here : https://railpack.com/config/environment-variables

For specific environment variables related to the provider detected by Railpack, you will need to refer to the docs for that provider. 
For ex, you can override the node version with `RAILPACK_BUN_VERSION` for the `Node` provider : https://railpack.com/languages/node

Here is an example of environment variables you can add : 
```shell
RAILPACK_DEPLOY_APT_PACKAGES="wget,git" # install wget & git with apt-get and persist it at build time
RAILPACK_BUN_VERSION=" 1.2.10" # install bun `1.2.10`
```


## Default Environment variables

when building with nixpacks, we will pass a default environment variable `FORCE_COLOR=true` for coloring build outputs.
