<Aside type="caution" title='Docker build resource usage'>
The Docker build process can consume up to 100% of your server's resources, potentially slowing it to a crawl.
Make sure your server is powerful enough to handle it.

[Railpack](https://railpack.com) is the new version of [Nixpacks](/knowledge-base/builders/nixpacks-builder/) by Railway, still open source. The benefits over Nixpacks are 
faster builds and smaller image sizes. The Railpack builder support all the same options as the Nixpacks builder. 

The Railpack builder is in **bêta** for now, as a **v1** of railpack hasn't been released yet. 

### How to create a service with with railpack

You can specify the Railpack builder when creating your service or modify the builder at any moment in the service's settings.

- You need to specify a **build directory**, where Railpack will detect and build your application, relative to the root of your repository
- You can specify custom **install**, **build** and **start** commands to configure Railpack and override the auto-generated 
  commands by Railpack

### Static websites

The Railpack builder support deploying static websites, when deploying a static website with ZaneOps, it will be built as a service using a [caddy on alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) image,
with your build assets copied exposed as a file server.
For that you need to check the static website checkbox and specify a publish directory relative to the build directory.

When updating your options in the UI, ZaneOps will show you a preview of the generated [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile) that will be used to host your app.

- You can also specify the path for a custom not found page, relative to the **published directory**, used for handling all 404 errors.
- If your app is a **Single Page Application (SPA)**, you can check the box and specify the location of **index.html** page to redirect requests to, 
  the Not found page is ignored as all requests will be sent to the **index.html** page instead.
