description: Overview of static directory builder

> Introduced in [**v1.9.0**](/changelog/v19)

With ZaneOps you can deploy pre-built HTML/CSS/JS websites using the static directory builder. 
It will be deployed using using a [caddy on alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) image.


- You can specify the **directory to publish** 
- You can specify a custom **not found page** 
- You can specify if the page **is an SPA** and where to redirect all requests to

### Overriding the default Caddyfile

When updating your options in the UI, ZaneOps will show you a preview of the generated [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile) 
that will be used to expose your app.
![Static directory service settings](https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/static-dir-builder.png)

You can override the generated file by providing a Caddyfile at the root of your **publish directory**. 
When specifying this, ZaneOps use it over the default generated one. 
With this you can add things like caching or simple HTTP basic authentication to your static websites. 

When specifying a custom Caddyfile, you can use :
- the environment variable **`$PUBLIC_ROOT`** as the root for static files
- the environment variable **`$PORT`** as the port for exposing your app

Here is A fully working example of a custom Caddyfile : 
```ini
# ./Caddyfile
# expose your app to $PORT and use 80 if undefined
:{$PORT:80} {
    # Set the root directory for static files
    root * {$PUBLIC_ROOT}
    # Serve static files 
    file_server
    # Add `cache-control` header to static assets, images and videos
    @assets {
        path_regexp assets \.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf|mp4)$
    }
    header @assets Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    # For all 404 errors, show a custom page
    handle_errors {
        @404 {
            expression {http.error.status_code} == 404
        }
        rewrite @404 ./404/index.html
        file_server
    }
}
```
