Using the API, you can trigger a new deployment for a service without needing authentication. 
This can be used to trigger a deployment in a Continuous Integration script.

### Example usage: Github actions

Automate your deployment workflow with GitHub Actions to update your application whenever changes are pushed to your repository:

<Steps>
1. Get your ZaneOps deployment webhook URL:
   Navigate to **service details page > settings > Deploy section > deploy webhook url**

2. Store your secrets in GitHub:
   Navigate to **GitHub repository > settings > secrets and variables > actions** and add:
   - `DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL`: Your ZaneOps webhook URL

3. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository:
    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/ci.yaml
    name: Deploy
    on:
      push:
        branches: [main] # customize as needed
    jobs:
      build-push-app:
        name: Build and Deploy Guestbook
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - name: Deploy to ZaneOps
              run: curl -f -o /dev/null -X PUT "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL }}" 
    ```
5. With this workflow in place, changes pushed to your main branch will automatically trigger a new build and deployment
