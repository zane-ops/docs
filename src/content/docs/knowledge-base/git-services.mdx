### Some notes about the build process

- Since `docker build` can be resource-intensive, ZaneOps try to limits its resource usage to a maximum of 50% of the CPU.
- When building your application, ZaneOps passes all environment variables as build `ARG` to the `docker build` command.
- It also builds your application within the service's current network, allowing access to other services in the same network during the build process.

    This enables tasks like generating Prisma types by connecting to your database during the build phase.
