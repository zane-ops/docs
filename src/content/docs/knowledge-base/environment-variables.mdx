### How to add a variable to a service

To add a variable to a service, you can go to the **service details page** > **Env variables tab**. 

- You can either add a single variable 
  ![Add a single variable](https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/single-env-variable.png)
- or add multiple variables from a `.env` file

### How to add a variable to an environment 

You can add variables to an environment by going to the **project details page** > **Variables tab**. 
Each variable added to an environment is available to all services in that environment.

You can also reference them in individual services by using a placeholder `{{env.VARIABLE_NAME}}`. All 
referenced variables are replaced at runtime when your app has been deployed. if the 
referenced variable doesn't exist in the environment, the placeholder will not be replaced. 



## System environment variables

ZaneOps provides a set of predefined variables you can use in your service.

- `ZANE`
  - Example: `true`
  - Flag indicating the service is deployed on ZaneOps.

- `ZANE_DOMAINS`
  - Example: `example.com,admin.example.com`
  - Comma-separated list of all public domains where this service is accessible.

- `ZANE_ENVIRONMENT`
  - Example: `production`
  - The environment name where the service is deployed (for example: `production`, `staging`).

- `ZANE_PRIVATE_DOMAIN`
  - Example: `service.project.internal.zaneops`
  - Internal project-scoped domain used to reach this service from other services in the same project.

- `ZANE_GLOBAL_PRIVATE_DOMAIN`
  - Example: `service.global.zaneops`
  - Global domain used to reach this service across the ZaneOps platform (across projects).

- `ZANE_DEPLOYMENT_TYPE`
  - Example: `docker` or `git`
  - The type of deployment for the service. `docker` indicates a container image; `git` indicates a source-based deployment.

- `ZANE_SERVICE_ID`
  - Example: `srv_01F2ABC3D4`
  - The unique identifier for the service.

- `ZANE_SERVICE_NAME`
  - Example: `my-service`
  - The slug or short name of the service.

- `ZANE_PROJECT_ID`
  - Example: `proj_0123ABCD`
  - The id of the project this service belongs to.

- `ZANE_DEPLOYMENT_SLOT`
  - Example: `blue` or `green`
  - The deployment slot for the running deployment (used for blue/green deployments).
    This is also sent as the HTTP header `x-zane-dpl-slot` on internal platform requests.

- `ZANE_DEPLOYMENT_HASH`
  - Example: `dpl_dkr_aBcDeFgHiJkLmN`
  - The unique hash for this specific deployment. This is also sent as the HTTP header `x-zane-dpl-hash`.
