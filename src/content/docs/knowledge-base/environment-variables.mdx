### How to add a variable to a service

To add a variable to a service, you can go to the **service details page** > **Env variables tab**. 

- You can either add a single variable

- or add multiple variables from a `.env` file

### How to add a variable to an environment 

You can add variables to an environment by going to the **project details page** > **Environments tab**. 
Each variable added to an environment is available to all services in that environment.

You can also reference them in individual services by using a placeholder `{{env.VARIABLE_NAME}}`. All 
referenced variables are replaced at runtime when your app has been deployed. if the 
referenced variable doesn't exist in the environment, the placeholder will not be replaced.
