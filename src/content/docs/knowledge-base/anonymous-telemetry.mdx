title: Anonymous Telemetry
description: Learn how and what ZaneOps collects with telemetry

> Since [**v1.10**](/changelog/v110)

## How does it work?

The anonymous telemetry feature helps us better understand how ZaneOps is actually used in production environments.

It works by sending a simple `PING` request at most every 30 minutes to the ZaneOps CDN ([cdn.zaneops.dev](https://cdn.zaneops.dev)).

The complete source code of the CDN can be found [here](https://github.com/zane-ops/cdn/tree/main/src/index.ts).

## How to disable?

You can easily disable anonymous telemetry by modifying the environment variable in your `.env` file:

```shell
# /var/www/zaneops/.env
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false # or true
```

## What does it collect?

When a PING request is sent to the CDN, we capture the requester's IP address and hash it twice: first using a SHA-256 hash, then a second time using HMAC-256 with a secret key that only the CDN knows. This process is irreversible, ensuring the data remains completely anonymous.

You can review the hashing implementation [here](https://github.com/zane-ops/cdn/blob/ab602e62e7013b3dc55c60eb29b5312e847c93fc/src/index.ts#L67-L79).
