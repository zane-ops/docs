### Anonymous Telemetry 

We introduced a new anonymous telemetry to allows us to better see the real usage of ZaneOps in production.

It works by sending a simple `PING` request at most every 30 minutes to the ZaneOps CDN ([cdn.zaneops.dev](https://cdn.zaneops.dev)). 
The code source of the CDN can be found [here](https://github.com/zane-ops/cdn/tree/main/src/index.ts).

Anonymous telemetry can be disabled by modifying the env variable in  `.env`: 

```shell
# /var/www/zaneops/.env
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false # or true
```
