ZaneOps automatically attempts to deploy your app using the [blue/green deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_deployment) strategy.
This ensures that your current version remains running and accessible while the new version is being deployed.

## Health Checks

To ensure your service is fully operational before switching it to production, we recommend using health checks.

Health checks provide an additional verification step during deployment and continuously monitor your app's health.

You can define a health check using either: 

- **Path**: ZaneOps will check that the specified endpoint returns a response with a succesful status code (`2xx`) during deployment.

- **Command**: ZaneOps will execute the specified command and ensure it exits with code `0`.

    <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/healthcheck-cmd-dark.png" alt="Service settings page - Healthcheck command section" />

For each new deployment, ZaneOps creates a monitoring job with the following settings:

- **Interval**: Specifies how often the health check runs.
- **Timeout**: Used only during the initial deployment, not for continuous monitoring.



<Aside type="tip" title="Good to Know">  
If you donâ€™t specify a health check, ZaneOps will only verify that the service container starts correctly and will continuously monitor that it remains running.

The default values for **timeout** and **interval** are both **30 seconds**.

## Situations That Disable Zero-Downtime Deployment

Zero-downtime deployment is disabled in two cases:

1. **When exposing ports**: To prevent conflicts with already exposed ports.

    <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/zero-downtime-warning-port-dark.png" alt="Warning for exposed ports disabling zero-downtime deployment" />

2. **When adding volumes without a host path**: To prevent conflicting writes to the same path.

    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/zero-downtime-warning-volume-light.png" alt="Warning for volume configuration disabling zero-downtime deployment" />
    <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src="/images/zero-downtime-warning-volume-dark.png" alt="Warning for volume configuration disabling zero-downtime deployment" />

    However, volumes with a **host path** still allow zero-downtime deployments, as ZaneOps mounts them in **read-only** mode.

If zero-downtime deployment is disabled for a service, ZaneOps will put the previous version to sleep while deploying the new version, making it temporarily inaccessible.

If the new version of the service fails the health check, ZaneOps will restart the previous version if it was put to sleep.
