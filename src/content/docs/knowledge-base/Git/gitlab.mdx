To connect your GitLab account to ZaneOps, you use GitLab apps. 


### How to create a GitLab app

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings > Git**: 
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/settings-git.png`} alt="Git settings" />
2. Choose Create GitHub app: 
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/create-gitlab-app.png`} alt="Create GitLab app" />

   <Aside type="caution" title="Redirect URI">
    The **Redirect URI** should be on a publicly accessible domain, 
    no need for https absolutely, but it is strongly recommended.
    
    If testing ZaneOps locally, you can use a service like https://webhook.site/ for forwarding webhooks 
    to your local instance.
   </Aside>

3. To get the credentials for the new app (`Application ID` and `Application Secret`) you need to create the app on your Gitlab instance: 
    
    At [https://\{your-gitlab-instance\}/-/profile/applications](https://{your-gitlab-instance}/-/profile/applications) click on 
   ** Add new application**:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/gitlab-app-list-gitlab.com.png`} alt="List gitlab apps" />
    
    Create a new application, with the scopes `api`, `read_user` and `read_repository`, 
    and use the same value for the Redirect URI as in the previous step:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/add-new-gitlab-app-gitlab.com.png`} alt="Add new gitlab app on gitlab.com" />

4. After submitting, you will be redirected to your GitLab instance and asked to authorize the application:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/authorize-gitlab-app-on-gitlab.com.png`} alt="Authorize gitlab app on gitlab.com" />

5. Once authorized, you will be redirected back to ZaneOps where you will see the newly created app.
   
   you can test the application installation to make sure it has access to your repositories: 
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/test-gitlab-app.png`} alt="Test GitLab app" />
</Steps>

### How to deploy a service from a GitLab app

<Steps>
1. Go to your **project > new service** and choose **Create from Git Provider**:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/create-from-git-provider.png`} alt="New service page" />
2. Choose the newly created GitLab app in the list of available apps:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/select-gitlab-app.png`} alt="Select Git app" />
3. There you can select the repository you want to deploy:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/choose-gitlab-repo.png`} alt="Create new Gitlab service" />
4. Once deployed, you will notice in the logs, that your app is cloned using the Gitlab access token, meaning that it worked !
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/gitlab-access-token.png`} alt="Git clone with access token" />
</Steps>


### Synchronize New repositories

Newly created repositories are not Synchronized by default with Gitlab apps, instead you need to manually synchronize 
them from the dashboard:

   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/sync-gitlab-repos.png`} alt="Sync GitLab repositories" />

### Updating GitLab app

If you rotated the secret or updated the redirect URI of your application on your GitLab instance, you can edit the gitlab app 
and paste in the new credentials:

<img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/edit-gitlab-app.png`} alt="Edit Gitlab app" />

Once done, you will be redirected to your gitlab instance and will need to authorize the app again:

<img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/authorize-gitlab-app-on-gitlab.com.png`} alt="Authorize gitlab app on gitlab.com" />
