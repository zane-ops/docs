Git apps are integrations with Git providers that allow you to listen to Git events from your repositories and perform actions on your behalf.

They can be installed either on your personal profile or within an organization youâ€™re a member of.

<Aside type="note" title="Public repositories">
ZaneOps supports both **public and private repositories**. 
However, only repositories where you are an **owner or maintainer** will appear in the list when creating a service.
