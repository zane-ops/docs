To connect your GitHub account to ZaneOps, you use GitHub apps. 


### How to create a GitHub app

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings > Git**: 
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/settings-git.png`} alt="Git settings" />
2. Choose Create GitHub app: 
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/create-github-app.png`} alt="Create GitHub app" />

   If you want to deploy repos from your organization, you can check **Install into organization ?** and fill 
   in the organization name:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/create-github-app-org.png`} alt="Create GitHub app with Org" />

   <Aside type="caution" title="webhook URL">
    The webhook URL should be on a publicly accessible domain on https.
    
    If testing ZaneOps locally, you can use a service like https://webhook.site/ for forwarding webhooks 
    to your local instance.
   </Aside>

3. Once you submit the form, you will be redirected to GitHub where you will need to give the app a name: 
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/create-github-app-github.com.png`} alt="Create GitHub app on Github.com" />

4. After submitting, you will be redirected back to ZaneOps where you will see the newly created app.
   You will need to install the application on GitHub to get access to the repositories you want to deploy on ZaneOps:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/install-git-app.png`} alt="Install github app" />
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/install-git-app-github.com.png`} alt="Install github app on GitHub" />

5. Once the application is installed, you can test the application installation to make sure it has access to your repositories: 
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/test-github-app.png`} alt="Test github app" />
</Steps>

### How to deploy a service from a GitHub app

<Steps>
1. Go to your **project > new service** and choose **Create from Git Provider**:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/create-from-git-provider.png`} alt="New service page" />
2. Choose the newly created Github app in the list of available apps:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/choose-github-app.png`} alt="Select Git app" />
3. There you can select the repository you want to deploy:
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/create-github-service.png`} alt="Create new github service" />
4. Once deployed, you will notice in the logs, that your app is cloned using github access token, meaning that it worked !
