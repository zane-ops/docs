Git apps are integrations with providers like **GitHub** and **GitLab** that allow you to
listen to Git events from your repositories and perform actions on your behalf.

They can be installed either on your personal profile or within an organization youâ€™re a member of.

With Git apps on ZaneOps, you get:

- Support for private GitHub and GitLab repositories.
