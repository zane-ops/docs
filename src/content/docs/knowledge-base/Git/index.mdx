ZaneOps supports creating and deploying applications from Git repositories.  
These applications are **built directly on the server** using [builders](/knowledge-base/builders) that detect or define how your code should be packaged and built.

Learn more about the available options in the [builders documentation](/knowledge-base/builders).

### From GitHub and GitLab

You can connect your account on ZaneOps using [Git applications](./git-apps). 
Using Git apps, you can deploy your public and private repositories with automatic deploys on Git push.


### From any provider

As well as GitHub and GitLab, you can deploy any repository as long as it is a public repository. 
You do so by specifying its repository URL. 

Keep in mind that using the repository URL, auto-deploy on Git push are not activated by default.
However you can setup a CI/CD script to deploy your apps using the API, [Learn more here](./auto-deploy#auto-deploy-via-api).
