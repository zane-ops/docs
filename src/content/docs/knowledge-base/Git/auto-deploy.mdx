When creating a service from a [Git app](../git-apps), **auto-deploy on Git push is enabled by default**.

You can customize this behavior:

- **Disable auto-deploy** if you donâ€™t want deployments triggered on every push
    <Aside type="note" title="On every push ?">
      Deployments are only triggered when the push is made to the same branch configured for the service.
    </Aside>
- **Automatically clean up the deployment queue** (enabled by default), this ensures that if multiple pushes happen in quick succession, only the latest one is deployed.
- **Add watch paths** to restrict auto-deploys to changes in specific files or directories.  
  These are defined using [Glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) (e.g., `frontend/**`, `{packages/trpc,packages/db,apps/web}/**`).

Deployments triggered by a Git push will appear with the label `git push`:
