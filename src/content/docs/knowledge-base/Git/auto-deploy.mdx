### Auto-deploy with Git apps


When creating a service from a [Git app](../git-apps), **auto-deploy on Git push is enabled by default**.

You can customize this behavior:

- **Disable auto-deploy** if you donâ€™t want deployments triggered on every push
    <Aside type="note" title="On every push ?">
      Deployments are only triggered when the push is made to the same branch configured for the service.
    </Aside>
- **Automatically clean up the deployment queue** (enabled by default), this ensures that if multiple pushes happen in quick succession, only the latest one is deployed.
- **Add watch paths** to restrict auto-deploys to changes in specific files or directories.  
  These are defined using [Glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) (e.g., `frontend/**`, `{packages/trpc,packages/db,apps/web}/**`).

Deployments triggered by a Git push will appear with the label `git push`:

### Auto-deploy via API

Using the API, you can trigger a new deployment for a service without needing to create a git apps. 
This can be used to trigger a deployment in a Continuous Integration script after a git push.

#### Example usage: Github actions

Automate your deployment workflow with GitHub Actions to update your application whenever changes are pushed to your repository:

<Steps>
1. Get your ZaneOps deployment webhook URL:
   Navigate to **service details page > settings > Deploy section > deploy webhook url**
   ![Locating the deployment webhook URL](https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/tuto-rr7-webhook-url.png)
   
2. Store your secrets in GitHub:
   Navigate to **GitHub repository > settings > secrets and variables > actions** and add:
   - `DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL`: Your ZaneOps webhook URL
   ![Adding repository secrets](https://assets.zaneops.dev/images/tuto-rr7-secrets.png)
   
3. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository:
    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/ci.yaml
    name: Deploy
    on:
      push:
        branches: [main] # customize as needed
    jobs:
      build-push-app:
        name: Build and Deploy Guestbook
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - name: Deploy to ZaneOps
              run: curl -f -o /dev/null -X PUT "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL }}" 
    ```
5. With this workflow in place, changes pushed to your main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment, 
   it will show in the list with the label `API` :
    
   <img src={`${ASSETS_SERVER_DOMAIN}/images/deploy-via-api.png`} alt="Service deployed via API" />

</Steps>
