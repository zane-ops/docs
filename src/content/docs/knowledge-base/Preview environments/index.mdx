Preview environments allow you to spin ephemeral environments for features. You might want 
to use them to:
- Test features in isolation before merging to production 
- To generate experiments
- A/B tests, etc.



## How do they work behind the scenes ?

By default when creating a preview environment, all the services from the base environment (production by default) will
be cloned to the new environment, including all service configurations & env variables, volumes are not cloned, instead
they are recreated, so data stays separated between each environment.

You can customize which services are cloned using [preview templates](./preview-templates).



## Creating preview environments

You can create preview environments two ways, via [API](./create-preview-from-api) or [pull request](./create-preview-from-pull-request).
