> Introduced in [**v1.12.0**](/changelog/v112)

Preview environments let you spin up **ephemeral copies of your apps** for testing and review.  
They are ideal when you want to:  

- Test features in isolation before merging to production  
- Run product experiments or proofs of concept  
- Conduct A/B testing with real services  
- Share a working feature branch with your team or stakeholders

### How do they work?

When you create a preview environment:  

- All services from a **base environment** (production by default) are **cloned** into a new environment.  
- Service configuration and environment variables are preserved.  
- **Volumes are not cloned**. Instead, fresh volumes are created to ensure data stays isolated between environments.  

You can control which services get cloned by defining a [preview template](./a-preview-templates).  
This allows you to include only the services needed for your feature or experiment.  


### Creating preview environments

There are two ways to create a preview environment:  

1. **Via API** — programmatically spin up previews for custom workflows. See [API guide](./create-preview-from-api).  
2. **Via Pull Request** — automatically create a preview when opening or updating a PR. See [PR integration](./create-preview-from-pull-request).

<Aside type="note" title="Good to know">
Preview environments are temporary by design. Once the feature branch is merged, closed or deleted, the preview is cleaned up automatically to save resources.
