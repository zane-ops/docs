> Introduced in [**v1.12.0**](/changelog/v112)

When creating a service from a [Git application](/knowledge-base/git/git-apps), **pull request previews** are enabled by default.  
You can manage this behavior in the service’s settings under **Auto-deploy options**:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src={`/images/auto-deploy-settings-light.png`} alt="Auto-deploy settings" />
  <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src={`/images/auto-deploy-settings-dark.png`} alt="Auto-deploy settings" />
</div>

### How it works

When a pull request is opened, ZaneOps automatically creates a **preview environment** for that PR.  

The associated Git application will also post a comment on the pull request, updating you on the **status of the preview deployment**.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src={`/images/pr-preview-comment-light.png`} alt="PR Preview comments" />
<img className="!hidden dark:!block" src={`/images/pr-preview-comment-dark.png`} alt="PR Preview comments" />

### Note about preview deployments from forks

When a pull request originates from a **forked repository**, ZaneOps will **create** the preview environment  but **will not automatically trigger its deployment**.  

The repository owner (or ZaneOps project owner) must **approve or decline** the preview deployment manually.

<div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src={`/images/preview-deploy-blocked-comment-light.webp`} alt="Preview deployment blocked GitHub comment" />
  <img className="!hidden dark:!block" src={`/images/preview-deploy-blocked-comment-dark.png`} alt="Preview deployment blocked GitHub comment" />
  <img src={`/images/preview-deploy-blocked.png`} alt="Preview deployment blocked UI" />
</div>

### Troubleshooting

#### Preview not appearing or stuck

- Check that **auto-deploy for pull requests** is enabled in your service settings.  
- Ensure the **Git app webhook** is correctly configured and hasn’t been disabled by your Git provider.  
- If the pull request comes from a fork, the deployment may be waiting for **manual approval**.  

#### No comment on the pull request

- The Git app needs write access to post comments.  
  Verify that the app has the required permissions under your repository’s **installed integrations**.  
- Check if commenting is disabled for bots or third-party apps in your repository settings.  

#### Preview not updating on new commits

- Make sure the preview was created with `"commit_sha": "HEAD"` (for branch-based previews).  
- If it was triggered manually with a specific commit SHA, new commits will be ignored.

You can always check detailed deployment logs from the **Service > Deployments** tab or redeploy the application manually via the dashboard.
