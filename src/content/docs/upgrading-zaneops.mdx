### Upgrading zaneops via the UI


### Upgrading zaneops via the terminal

<Aside type="tip">
While zaneops is being upgraded, all your services will still be available, including the zaneops dashboard. 
</Aside>

zaneops is updated automatically to the version specified in the `.env` file in `IMAGE_VERSION`. 
However if you use the `canary` version, you will automatically be updated to the latest version on the `main` branch, **which can contain breaking changes ⚠️**.

To update the version, change it in `.env` : 

```shell
# /var/www/zaneops/.env
IMAGE_VERSION="v2"
# ... other env variables
```

Then deploy again with : 

```shell
make setup # re-download configuration files to run zaneops 
make deploy
```
