## Introduction

Railway recently introduced [functions support](https://railway.com/changelog/2025-02-07-railway-functions#railway-functions) 
based on bun. It allows you to quickly wip up a simple API.

You can achieve the same thing in ZaneOps too leveraging our **Config files** feature.

### Live demo

You can find a production version of this application at: https://bun-function.fkiss.me

## Prerequisites

- A working ZaneOps instance. If you need help with installation, refer to our [ZaneOps setup guide](/installation).



## Process

<Steps>
1. Create a Docker service using `oven/bun` image:

2. Go to the service settings page and add a new config file with the the mount path of `/app/index.ts` containing your code:
    ![Config file content](/images/tuto-bun-fn-config-file.png)

    ```ts
    // /app/index.ts
    // index.tsx (Bun v1.2 runtime)
    import { Hono } from "hono@4";
    import { cors } from 'hono/cors';

    const app = new Hono();

    app.use("/*", cors());
    app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello world!"));
    app.get("/api/health", (c) => c.json({ status: "ok" }));

    Bun.serve({
        port: import.meta.env.PORT ?? 3000,
        fetch: app.fetch,
    });
    ```

3. Update the start command to run the script on startip:
   ```shell
   bun run /app/index.ts
   ```

4. Add a URL to the service Forwarded to the port `3000`:
