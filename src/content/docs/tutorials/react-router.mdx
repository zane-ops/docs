import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


[React router v7](https://reactrouter.com) is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. 
In this article, we are going to deploy a React router application to ZaneOps.

## Prerequisities

- A ZaneOps instance setup and working, you can look into [how to install and setup ZaneOps here](/installation)

## Process

### Clone the project

We will be working from this repository : https://github.com/zane-ops/guestbook, so you can clone or fork the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zane-ops/guestbook.git
```

The app we will work on is a guestbook app made with react router v7, with these features : 

- github authentication : with sessions stored in **redis**
- writing messages : with messages stored in a **postgres** database and using drizzle as the ORM
- full SSR with progressive enhancement (can work without JavaScript enabled)

### Set up GitHub OAuth

<Steps>

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) and create some new OAuth/regular app.

2. Fill in the form with the following values :
   - Application name : `<your-app-name>`
   - Homepage URL : `http://guestbook.127-0-0-1.sslip.io` 
   - Callback URL : `http://guestbook.127-0-0-1.sslip.io/api/auth/callback/github`
    <Aside type='note'>
    If you use ZaneOps on production, please update the domain `guestbook.127-0-0-1.sslip.io` to where your app is installed.
    </Aside>

3. Once the app is created, you will be able to see the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Coppy these values to the `.env` file :

    ```shell
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your_client_id>"
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your_client_secret>"
    GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI="http://guestbook.127-0-0-1.sslip.io/api/auth/callback/github"
    ```
</Steps>


### Create a project in ZaneOps

Login to your ZaneOps instance and on the dashboard, create a new project named **guestbook** :

![Project created](/images/tuto-rr7-project-created.png)

### Create postgres and redis services

In your project page, create a new service for redis, we will use the image [valkey](https://valkey.io/) which is an open source version 
of redis.

<Steps>
1. Create a docker service using `valkey/valkey` as the image :
    ![Create new service for valkey](/images/tuto-rr7-create-valkey.png)
2. Deploy it :
    ![Valkey service created](/images/tuto-rr7-valkey-created.png)
3. You can check on the service details page to see if the deployment succeeded : 
    ![Valkey service page](/images/tuto-rr7-valkey-deployed.png)
</Steps>


Back in your project, we will create a new service for postgres :
<Steps>
1. Create a docker service using `postgres` as the image :
    ![Create new service for postgres](/images/tuto-rr7-create-pg.png)

2. This time, we will need to configure the service, so can go to the service details page and env variable tab :
    ![Valkey service created](/images/tuto-rr7-pg-env-tab.png)

3. Click on **Add from .env** and paste these variables in the modal :
   ```shell
    POSTGRES_DB="guestbook"
    POSTGRES_USER="guestbook"
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD="guestbook"
   ```
    ![Valkey service page](/images/tuto-rr7-pg-env-modal.png)
    ![Valkey service page](/images/tuto-rr7-pg-env-added.png)

4. Go to the settings tab and add a volume for persisting the data : 
    ![Valkey service page](/images/tuto-rr7-pg-add-volume.png)

5. You can review the changes and deploy your service now : 
    ![Valkey service page](/images/tuto-rr7-pg-changes.png)
    ![Valkey service page](/images/tuto-rr7-pg-deployed.png)
</Steps>

### Create the main application

<Steps>
1. Create a docker service with the image `ghcr.io/zane-ops/guestbook` :
    ![Create guestbook service](/images/tuto-rr7-create-gb-app.png)
2. On the env variables tab add these variables :
    Copy your github credentials from the [github OAuth step](#set-up-github-oauth)
    ```shell
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your_client_id>" 
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your_client_secret>"
    GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI="http://guestbook.127-0-0-1.sslip.io/api/auth/callback/github"
    SESSION_DOMAIN="guestbook.127-0-0-1.sslip.io"
    SESSION_SECRET="yoursupersecretvalue"
    SESSION_SECURE="false"
   ``` 
   ![Add env variables](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-env-1.png)
   <Aside type='note'>
   If you are working with ZaneOps on production, it's highly recommended to set `SESSION_SECURE` to `true`
   to only allow session authentication via https.
   </Aside>

3. We will also need to two more variables, `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL`, for that you need to copy the 
   network aliases for redis and docker services.

   Go to the **redis service details page > settings > Networking section**, and copy the network alias : 
   ![Redis network alias](/images/tuto-rr7-alias-redis.png)

   And add it as an env variable to your main app service : 
   ```shell
   REDIS_URL="redis://<redis_network_alias>:6379"
   ```
   ![Add redis env](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-env-2.png)

   Go to the **postgres service details page > settings > Networking section**, and copy the network alias : 
   ![postgres network alias](/images/tuto-rr7-alias-pg.png)

   And add it as an env variable to your main app service : 
   ```shell
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://guestbook:guestbook@<postgres_network_alias>:5432/guestbook"
   ```
   ![Add postgres env](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-env-3.png)
4. Add a URL for the service to expose the service to the public : 
    Go to the **service details page > settings > Networking section > URLS** and add 
    an URL with the domain `guestbook.127-0-0-1.sslip.io` and the forwarded port to `3000`, that's the 
    port where our service is exposed 

    ![Add URL for service](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-add-url.png)

5. Add a health check for making sure the application starts correctly :
   Go to the **service details page > settings > Deploy section > Healthcheck** and add a health check : 
   - type : `Path`
   - value : `/api/health`, an endpoint that is checked to make sure the app is up
   - Listening port : `3000`, the same as the port for the URL

   ![Add Healthcheck for service](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-add-healthcheck.png)

6. You can review the changes and deploy : 
   ![Review changes for service](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-changes-modal.png)

7. You can inspect the logs of the deployment to make sure it works : 
   ![Deployment done](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-deployed.png)
   ![Deployment logs](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-logs.png)
8. Once everything is okay, your app will be available at http://guestbook.127-0-0-1.sslip.io
   ![Demo of the app](/images/tuto-rr7-gb-demo.png)
</Steps>


### Setting up automatic deployments 

To automatically deploy your app every time you make changes, you can use github actions. 
The process is usually like this : 
1. Build your app with Docker and tag it with the latest commit sha
2. Deploy your container to a docker registry
3. Trigger a deployment on ZaneOps and pass the latest tag for the image for your service

In this tutorial, we will use the github container registry (`ghcr.io`) as our container registry.

<Steps>
1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) and create a new access token with the permissions `repo`, `write:packages` and `delete:packages` 
   ![Demo of the app](/images/tuto-rr7-github-container-pat.png)
2. In your ZaneOps instance, go to your **main app service details page > settings > Deploy section > deploy webhook url** and copy the webhook url 
   ![Webhook url screenshot](/images/tuto-rr7-webhook-url.png)
3. Go to your **GitHub repository > settings > secrets and variables > actions** and Add the value for the access token to `CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PAT` and the webhook url to `DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL`
   ![Webhook url screenshot](/images/tuto-rr7-secrets.png)
4. Add a new github workflow in your repository, it should look something like this : 
    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/ci.yaml
    name: Deploy
    on:
        # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
        push:
            branches:
                - main # you can change this if needed
        # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
        workflow_dispatch:
    jobs:
        build-push-app:
            name: Build and Push Guestbook app
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            permissions:
                packages: write
                contents: read
                attestations: write
                id-token: write
            steps:
                - name: Checkout
                  uses: actions/checkout@v4
                - name: Set up Docker Buildx
                  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
                - name: Log in to the Container registry
                  uses: docker/login-action@65b78e6e13532edd9afa3aa52ac7964289d1a9c1
                  with:
                      registry: ghcr.io
                      username: ${{ github.actor }}
                      password: ${{ secrets.CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PAT }}
                - name: Build and push
                  uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
                  with:
                      context: .
                      file: Dockerfile
                      push: true
                      tags: ghcr.io/zane-ops/guestbook:${{ github.sha }} # change to the tag of your image
                - name: Deploy to Zaneops
                  uses: zane-ops/auto-deploy-action@v4
                  with:
                      SERVICE_IMAGE: ghcr.io/zane-ops/guestbook:${{ github.sha }} # change to the tag of your image
                      DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL }}
                      COMMIT_MESSAGE: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
                # You can also do this 
                #- name: Deploy to Zaneops
                #  run: |
                #    curl -f -X PUT "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL }}" \
                #       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                #       -d '{
                #             "new_image": "ghcr.io/zane-ops/docs:${{ github.sha }}",
                #             "commit_message": "${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"
                #           }'
    ```
5. Now every time you push a change to the `main` branch, it will be reflected on the dashboard
