## What is Zaneops ?

ZaneOps is a beautiful, self-hosted, open source platform for hosting static sites, web apps, databases, services (like Supabase, Wordpress, Ghost), Workers or anything you need whether you start a startup or Enterprise.

It is an free and open-source alternative to platforms like Heroku, Railway and Render, leveraging the scalability of [Docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) and the flexibility of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).
