## What is Zaneops ?

ZaneOps is a **beautiful, self-hosted, open-source** platform for hosting static sites, web apps, databases, services (like Supabase, WordPress, Ghost), workers, or anything else you needâ€”whether you're launching a startup or managing an enterprise.  

It is a **free** and **open-source** alternative to platforms like **Heroku, Railway, and Render**, leveraging the **scalability** of [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) and the **flexibility** of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).
