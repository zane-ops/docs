title: Configuring Domains and DNS Records for ZaneOps
description: 'Guide to Configuring DNS records for zaneops'
---

import {Aside} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

ZaneOps requires specific DNS records to be set up for your domains. The primary environment variables related to domains are:

- [`ROOT_DOMAIN`](#root_domain): Used to generate subdomains for deployed web apps.
- [`ZANE_APP_DOMAIN`](#zane_app_domain): The domain where the ZaneOps dashboard will be accessible after deployment. It can be the same as `ROOT_DOMAIN`.

<Aside type="tip" title="Important">
You can use any domain you want for services created in ZaneOps, you are not restricted to `ROOT_DOMAIN` or `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN`.

For example, your `ROOT_DOMAIN` might be [zaneops.dev](//zaneops.dev) and your `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN` [admin.zaneops.dev](//admin.zaneops.dev), but a service can still use a domain like [mysupersaas.com](//mysupersaas.com).

### Required DNS Records

You need to add the following records in your DNS provider:

```txt
*     IN  A    <your-server-ip>       # Wildcard Subdomain (`*.<ROOT_DOMAIN>`, to support subdomains dynamically)
app   IN  A    <your-server-ip>       # ZANE_APP_DOMAIN
```

On [cloudflare](//cloudflare.com), it looks like this :

### Verifying DNS Records

Ensure that these records are correctly propagated by checking them with a DNS lookup tool such as `dig` or `nslookup` : 

```shell
# Using `dig`
dig +short admin.zaneops.dev A

# Using `nslookup`
nslookup admin.zaneops.dev
```


#### **`ROOT_DOMAIN`**

This variable is used for generating subdomains for your services. 

for example if your root domain is [zaneops.dev](https://zaneops.dev), urls for your services will be generated 
as [project-service-randomid.zaneops.dev](//project-service-randomid.zaneops.dev). This variable is also used for generating unique urls for your deployments.

In the dashboard, this is what is used when you leave the `domain` field empty when you add urls for your service :

<Aside type='note' title='Default value'>
By default the setup script of zaneops generate a [sslip.io](https://sslip.io) domain based on the IP of your server (ex: https://198-19-249-134.sslip.io),
and you can change this at any moment. 
</Aside>



#### **`ZANE_APP_DOMAIN`**

This variable corresponds to the domain where the zaneops dashboard will be accessible. 
You can safely set this variable to the same value as the `ROOT_DOMAIN`, the domain itself is not used for anything else.

By default, the setup script of ZaneOps will generate this with the same value as `ROOT_DOMAIN`.

## Disabling SSL 

By default zaneops, will only expose the port `443` to the public, with all services served over https. 
But in some cases where you have another proxy on top on your server (ex: [Cloudflare tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/), [Cloudflare proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/)),
 which handles SSL for you, you might want to disable SSL on your server. 

- To enable HTTP, you can modify the `.env` file and update the `MODE` variable to `http` :

    ```shell
    # /var/www/zaneops/.env
    # ... other env variables
    MODE=http
    ```

- You will need to restart your zaneops instance :

    ```shell
    make stop # stop zaneops and all the services managed by it
    make deploy # start zaneops again
    ``` 
 
<Aside type="note" title="Server without a public IP">
In some cases, you might want to disable secure connection to your server, if you are testing on a non production server
which doesn't have a public IP (meaning you can only access your server with `http://`).

For that you will need to modify the `__DANGEROUS_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION` environment variable in your `.env` file to `"true"`.
However, this is strongly discouraged to use in production, 
as it allows for connecting to your dashboard using non secure cookies.

This can be perfectly OK though, for use-cases like using ZaneOps to host apps on a local network not accessible from the internet.

## Using Cloudflare tunnel

[Cloudflare tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) is a popular way to host applications without needing 
to expose your server IP to the internet. 

For hosting zaneops behing cloudflare tunnel, you will need to : 
1. [Disable ssl](#disabling-ssl)
2. Add the records on the public hostname tab on your tunnel instance, all forwarded to http://127.0.0.1:80 :
